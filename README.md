## Gravity Simulator
This slightly janky gravity simulator is a play with 3D rendering with raylib, using basic physics equations to show more complex pheomenon, like orbiting bodies and the formation of stars from space dust.
It is written in pure C and them compiled to Web Assemby via emscripten.
